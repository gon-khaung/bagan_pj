												<p style="color: #666600; text-align: justify;">Bagan (Burmese: ပုဂံ;
													formerly Pagan) is an ancient city and a
													UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Mandalay Region of
													Myanmar. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the
													city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that
													unified the regions that would later
													constitute modern Myanmar. During the kingdom's height between the
													11th and 13th centuries, 4,446 Buddhist
													temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan
													plains alone, of which the remains of 3,822
													temples and pagodas still survive to the present day.[citation
													needed]

													The Bagan Archaeological Zone is a main attraction for the country's
													nascent tourism industry.</p>

													<strong>Etymology</strong>
												</h4>

												<p style="color: #666600; text-align: justify;">Bagan is the present-day
													standard Burmese pronunciation of the
													Burmese word Pugan (ပုဂံ), derived from Old Burmese Pukam (ပုကမ်).
													Its classical Pali name is Arimaddanapura
													(အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ, lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies"). Its other
													names in Pali are in reference to its
													extreme dry zone climate: ( "parched land"), and ("bronzed
													country").The Burmese chronicles also report
													other classical names of Thiri Pyissaya ( Pali: Siripaccaya) and
													Tampawaddy (Pali: Tampavatī).</p>

												<h4>History</h4>
												<h5>9th to 13th centuries</h5>
												<p style="color: #666600; text-align: justify;">According to the Burmese
													chronicles, Bagan was founded in the
													second century AD, and fortified in 849 AD by King Pyinbya, 34th
													successor of the founder of early Bagan.
													Mainstream scholarship however holds that Bagan was founded in the
													mid-to-late 9th century by the Mranma
													(Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the
													Nanzhao Kingdom. It was among several
													competing Pyu city-states until the late 10th century when the
													Burman settlement grew in authority and
													grandeur.

													From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political,
													economic and cultural nerve center of the
													Pagan Empire. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan's rulers and their
													wealthy subjects constructed over
													10,000 religious monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small
													temples and 3000 monasteries) in an area
													of 104 square kilometres (40 sq mi) in the Bagan plains. The
													prosperous city grew in size and grandeur, and
													became a cosmopolitan center for religious and secular studies,
													specializing in Pali scholarship in grammar
													and philosophical-psychological (abhidhamma) studies as well as
													works in a variety of languages on prosody,
													phonology, grammar, astrology, alchemy, medicine, and legal studies.
													The city attracted monks and students
													from as far as India, Sri Lanka and the Khmer Empire.

													The culture of Bagan was dominated by religion. The religion of
													Bagan was fluid, syncretic and by later
													standards, unorthodox. It was largely a continuation of religious
													trends in the Pyu era where Theravada
													Buddhism co-existed with Mahayana Buddhism, Tantric Buddhism,
													various Hindu (Saivite, and Vaishana) schools
													as well as native animist (nat) traditions. While the royal
													patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the
													mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain
													primacy, other traditions continued to
													thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen.

													The Pagan Empire collapsed in 1287 due to repeated Mongol invasions
													(1277–1301). Recent research shows that
													Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that even if
													they did, the damage they inflicted was
													probably minimal.[9] However, the damage had already been done. The
													city, once home to some 50,000 to
													200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain
													its preeminence. The city formally ceased
													to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the Myinsaing
													Kingdom became the new power in Upper Burma.
												</p>

												<h5>14th to 19th centuries</h5>
												<p style="color: #666600; text-align: justify;">Bagan survived into the
													15th century as a human settlement, and
													as a pilgrimage destination throughout the imperial period. A
													smaller number of "new and impressive"
													religious monuments still went up to the mid-15th century but
													afterward, new temple constructions slowed to
													a trickle with fewer than 200 temples built between the 15th and
													20th centuries. The old capital remained a
													pilgrimage destination but pilgrimage was focused only on "a score
													or so" most prominent temples out of the
													thousands such as the Ananda, the Shwezigon, the Sulamani, the
													Htilominlo, the Dhammayazika, and a few other
													temples along an ancient road. The rest—thousands of less famous,
													out-of-the-way temples—fell into
													disrepair, and most did not survive the test of time.

													For the few dozen temples that were regularly patronized, the
													continued patronage meant regular upkeep as
													well as architectural additions donated by the devotees. Many
													temples were repainted with new frescoes on
													top of their original Pagan era ones, or fitted with new Buddha
													statutes. Then came a series of
													state-sponsored "systematic" renovations in the Konbaung period
													(1752–1885), which by and large were not
													true to the original designs—some finished with "a rude plastered
													surface, scratched without taste, art or
													result". The interiors of some temples were also whitewashed, such
													as the Thatbyinnyu and the Ananda. Many
													painted inscriptions and even murals were added in this period.</p>
												<h5>20th century to present</h5>
												<p style="color: #666600; text-align: justify;">Bagan, located in an
													active earthquake zone, had suffered from
													many earthquakes over the ages, with over 400 recorded earthquakes
													between 1904 and 1975. A major earthquake
													occurred on 8 July 1975, reaching 8 MM in Bagan and Myinkaba, and 7
													MM in Nyaung-U. The quake damaged many
													temples, in many cases, such as the Bupaya, severely and
													irreparably. Today, 2229 temples and pagodas
													remain.

													Many of these damaged pagodas underwent restorations in the 1990s by
													the military government, which sought
													to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the
													restoration efforts instead drew widespread
													condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide.
													Critics are aghast that the restorations
													paid little attention to original architectural styles, and used
													modern materials, and that the government
													has also established a golf course, a paved highway, and built a
													61-meter (200-foot) watchtower. Although
													the government believed that the ancient capital's hundreds of
													(unrestored) temples and large corpus of
													stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation
													of UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city
													was not so designated until 2019, allegedly mainly on account of the
													restorations.

													Bagan today is a main tourist destination in the country's nascent
													tourism industry, which has long been the
													target of various boycott campaigns. The majority of over 300,000
													international tourists to the country in
													2011 are believed to have also visited Bagan.[citation needed]
													Several Burmese publications note that the
													city's small tourism infrastructure will have to expand rapidly even
													to meet a modest pickup in tourism in
													the following years.

													On 24 August 2016, a major earthquake hit central Burma and again
													did major damage in Bagan; this time
													almost 400 temples were destroyed. The Sulamani and Myauk Guni
													(North Guni) were severely damaged. The Bagan
													Archaeological Department has started a survey and reconstruction
													effort with the help of UNESCO experts.
													Visitors are prohibited from entering 33 damaged temples.

													On 6 July 2019, Bagan was officially inscribed as a World Heritage
													Site by UNESCO, after 24 years since the
													military government first nominated the city in 1995, during the
													43rd session of the World Heritage
													Committee. This makes Bagan the second World Heritage Site in
													Myanmar, after the Ancient Cities of Pyu. As
													part of the criteria for the inscription of Bagan, the government of
													Myanmar has pledged to relocate
													existing hotels in the archaeological zone to a dedicated hotel zone
													by 2028.</p>
